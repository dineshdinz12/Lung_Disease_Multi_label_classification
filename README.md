     import requests
     
     url = 'http://localhost:5000/api/analyze'
     files = {'image': open('chest_xray.jpg', 'rb')}
     response = requests.post(url, files=files)
     results = response.json()
     ```

## Model Architecture

This project implements a custom deep learning model based on DenseNet121 with the following architecture:

- **Base Model**: DenseNet121 (trained from scratch)
- **Model Split**: 70-10-20 (Training-Validation-Test)
- **Special Handling**: NF (No Finding) class with optimized threshold
- **Architecture Components**:
  - DenseNet121 backbone with custom head
  - Global Average Pooling layer
  - Dropout (0.5) for regularization
  - Dense layers for multi-label classification
  - Sigmoid activation for multi-label predictions

The model is trained from scratch on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, with special attention to handling the "No Finding" class and maintaining high accuracy across all disease categories.
