   - Visualizations include accuracy/loss curves, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve

## Model Training Process

### Dataset

Our model was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset, which contains 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with 14 different thoracic disease labels. The dataset was split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Image Resizing**: All images were resized to 224x224 pixels
2. **Normalization**: Pixel values were normalized to the range [0, 1]
3. **Augmentation**: Training data was augmented using:
   - Random horizontal flips
   - Random rotations (±10 degrees)
   - Random brightness and contrast adjustments
   - Random zoom (±10%)

### Model Architecture

We used a pre-trained EfficientNet-B4 model as the backbone, which was fine-tuned on our chest X-ray dataset. The model architecture includes:

- **Backbone**: EfficientNet-B4 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Global Average Pooling**: Reduces spatial dimensions
- **Dropout**: 0.5 dropout rate to prevent overfitting
- **Dense Layer**: 14 output neurons (one for each disease class)
- **Activation**: Sigmoid for multi-label classification

### Training Process

1. **Pre-training**: The model was pre-trained on ImageNet
2. **Fine-tuning**: The model was fine-tuned on our chest X-ray dataset
3. **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of 1e-4
4. **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
5. **Batch Size**: 32
6. **Epochs**: 50 with early stopping (patience=5)
7. **Learning Rate Schedule**: Reduce on plateau (factor=0.5, patience=3)

### Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1 Score**: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **Kappa**: Measures inter-rater agreement
- **MCC**: Matthews Correlation Coefficient, suitable for imbalanced datasets

## Technical Details

### Backend

- **Framework**: Flask
- **Model**: PyTorch with EfficientNet-B4
- **Image Processing**: PIL, torchvision
- **API**: RESTful API for image upload and analysis

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React
- **UI Library**: Material-UI
- **Charts**: Chart.js
- **File Upload**: react-dropzone

### Performance Optimization

- **Model Quantization**: The model is quantized to reduce inference time
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple images can be processed in a single batch
- **Caching**: Results are cached to avoid redundant processing
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded only when needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Error parsing analysis results"**:
   - Check if the model file exists: `ls -la model.pth`
   - Test the model directly: `python test_main.py`
   - Test the backend connection: `python test_connection.py`
   - Check the backend logs for any errors

2. **Slow Performance**:
   - Ensure you have a CUDA-compatible GPU
   - Reduce the image size before uploading
   - Check your internet connection

3. **Upload Issues**:
   - Ensure the image is in a supported format (JPEG, JPG, PNG)
   - Check that the file size is under 5MB
   - Try a different browser

### Debugging

For debugging, you can use the following scripts:

- `test_main.py`: Test the output from main.py
- `test_connection.py`: Test the connection between the backend and frontend
- `run_backend.py`: Run the backend server with debugging enabled
- `run_frontend.sh`: Run the frontend with debugging enabled
